## WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS TECHNIQUE IN REAL WORLD!!
### Set up
For cache poisoning, if you want to replicate our attacks.

First run `npm i` in this directory
Then run `npm start`, and you can choose four urls from the terminal output. Paste the urls to your browser, and open you dev tools. You can see the output in the `Console` tab.

You should see a cat image at first.

### Launch attacks
In `sw.js`, the first two lines are commented, they corresponding to two different attacks.

1. Comment out the `// importScripts('change_img.js');`, you can see the image changed from cat to pandas, and attackers can do this remotely.
2. Comment out the `// importScripts('change_html.js');`, you can see the main page html was tampered to a remote html page.

### Troubleshooting
If the attacks is not working, remember to clean the service worker cache everytime.
